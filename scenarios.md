# Scenario - 02

## Price Rules

A memo from the Sales team has been received which clarifies the pricing flexibility that they are after.

### Cloud Retail Portal - Pricing Flexibility

Prices can be set by Customer, by product and for a specified time, or all of these in combination.

Rules are applied in order of specificity, that is the one that matches the most criteria is applied in preference of ones with less matching criteria.

For example if there are 2 price rules 'Rule 1' and 'Rule 2' for a particular customer. Both rules are linked to the customer, but one of the 'Rule 2' also applies to a specific product, 'Prouduct A'.

If the customer purchases 'Product A' then 'Rule 2' will apply.

If the customer purchases any product other than 'Product A', then 'Rule 1' will apply.

If 2 rules have the same criteria and are valid at the same time period the newest rule wins.

### Types of pricing

1. Percent mark-up from cost
2. Percent margin
3. Fixed AUD$ mark-up (per quantity)
