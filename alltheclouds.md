## About All The Clouds

- All The Clouds is one of the world's most respected providers of cloud.

- Having been in the business of cloud provision for eons, All The Clouds has an extensive network of production facilities and sales offices, enabling them to guarantee global cloud delivery.

- All The Clouds operates a huge enterprise ERP system to ensure on-time delivery of clouds, but as we know, most ERPs were developed back in the dark ages and whilst they provide massive scale for the back-office of companies, they often struggle to keep up with the fast-changing world of customer demands.

- All The Clouds has overcome this limitation by building a modern API in front of their ERP so that their customers and resellers can access product information and place orders through the API rather than through the original batch processing system provided by their ERP.

- The API was initially developed to service the needs of a single reseller, but as time has passed, its use has expanded to more and more of their customers.

- Initially there wasn't much consideration given to API strategy or architecture, and as the API has incrementally evolved, All The Clouds has realised they will need to introduce some more appropriate controls on the API such as authentication and rate limiting to avoid misuse.
