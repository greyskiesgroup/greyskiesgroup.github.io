# Architectural Steering Committee

Established by the CTO the Architectural steering committee is made up of the Architect, Snr. Software Engineer, and a Snr. Software Developer from each team, there is also as well as a representative from the Sales and Logistics teams. 

The committee is overseen by the CTO and was created to increase cross team cooperation, and to provide consistent and effective standards for systems design and development.

Only founded recently to align with the creation of the Cloud Systems team the commitee has yet to establish a set of guidelines for the teams to adhere too.
