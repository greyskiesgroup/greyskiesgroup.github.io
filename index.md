Although fictional the Grey Skies Group is representative of a medium size enterprise which sells items to other businesses.  
With its headquarters in Brisbane, Australia there are also regional sales and logistics operations across Australia, in the United States of America, and in the United Kingdom, giving Grey Skies Group a global footprint.

An area of growth for the group over the past 3 years has been its cloud retail business. As one of the worldâ€™s premier cloud retailers Grey Skies Group prides itself on the efficiency which its customers can order from a large catalogue of clouds and have them delivered quickly and cost effectively.

The smallest and newest team, **Cloud Systems** , was introduced to support the growing Cloud sales sector.

_As the new sparkly team on the block the Snr. Software Engineer and Architect have shown a keen interest in the Cloud Systems team and want to make their mark by getting involved. You can be sure they will be interested in having their 2 cents about all the decisions getting made._

## Existing Technologies

All the software applications developed for Grey Skies Group have been build using MS development tooling and the .Net.NET framework (varying versions). Priding itself on its ability to &quot;keep up&quot; with technical advances all systems are running the Microsoft Azure platform, to make them &quot;cloud apps&quot;.

### Rainydays

This is actually 3 separate ASP.Net.NET MVC apps (.Net.NET Framework version 4.5), ): one for Finance, one for Inventory, and one for Logistics. Backed by a shared Azure SQL database these apps have not seen much evolution since their inception 7 years ago.

Historically all interaction with Grey Skies Group suppliers have been integration directly from the Rainydays inventory application.

### Snowstorm

AngularJS single page application in front of an ASP.Net.NET Web API (.Net.NET Framework version 4.5). This application is significantly newer than Rainydays and was built to replace Greys Skies Group&#39;s dependence on Microsoft Dynamics as it failed to deliver on the features and the Mobile mobile capabilities required for the Grey Skies Group sales team.

### Integrations

When sales people place orders for customers in Snowstorm that order is &quot;submitted&quot; to Rainydays by adding a new order to the &quot;IncommingOrders&quot; table for the shared Rainydays database.

## More detail about Grey Skies Group

- Grey Skies Group has recently appointed a new CTO to attempt to resolve the issues they have been having keeping their internals systems competitive. The first project undertaken by the new CTO was to migrate all of the internal systems off self-hosted servers to Microsoft Azure.

- The new CTO is also responsible for the creation of the Cloud Systems team and backing the team to work with an Agile agile project structure.

- The Grey Skies Group executive leadership team consider &quot;responsiveness&quot; to be a key principle for the organisation&#39;s success. This responsiveness is expected in all aspects of the organisation and in turn it&#39;s systems. This means sales staff must get back to customers within minutes, not hours, logistics have extremely aggressive targets for deliveries, and the software systems are expected to by be &quot;fast&quot; no matter where the customer is located.

- With the move to Azure this means that each application has a node in each of the main countries or regions.
