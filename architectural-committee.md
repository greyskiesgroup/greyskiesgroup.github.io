# Architectural Steering Committee (ASC)

Established by the CTO the Architectural steering committee is made up of the Architect, Snr. Software Engineer, and a Snr. Software Developer from each team, there is also as well as a representative from the Sales and Logistics teams. 

The committee is overseen by the CTO and was created to increase cross team cooperation, and to provide consistent and effective standards for systems design and development.

Only founded recently to align with the creation of the Cloud Systems team the committee has yet to establish a set of guidelines for the teams to adhere too. 
However, there are some recommendations base on GSGs enterprise vendor agreements.

## Cloud Service Provider
Grey Skies Group has made the commercial decisions to use Microsoft Azure for is cloud service provider. There is an agreement in place and each team will be allocated a subscription for dev/test but all production infrastructure is to be deployed to the GSGGlobal Production subscription.

Deployment to the production system can be automated via the Azure DevOps tool but the configuration of the infrastructure must have prior approval from the ASC.
